Enriches your posts by adding a quick, 'visual' Wikipedia-driven search.

== Description ==

Treat your visitors with a Wikipedia&reg;-driven ***visual*** search for your content!

Visual Chap places its discreet icon on the side of your posts content, following any scroll of your visitor's window: tapping the icon opens a panel and the words in that content will become click-able, picture-focused Wikipedia searches. It is also possible to trigger the search by selecting ( or 'highlighting') text.

Features:

* _Y_Power's FlexSearch algorithm
* words filter
* animated UI
* top margin adjustment
* colors customization

Visual Chap will be **ONLY ACTIVE IN 'EMPTY' PARAGRAPHS** - which means it will bypass a particular paragraph if it finds there are already links in it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How about mobile devices? =

Visual Chap will **NOT** be displayed on smaller devices, at the moment: development for these is ongoing.

= How about i18(internationalization)? =

Visual Chap is only available in English, at the moment ('en' servers).
However, it is already translatable  and I'd love to make it available in other languages as well (I'm a polyglot myself) but that would require a specific search algorithm for each domain, which could be done, with some help from other developers, just by substituting the search function in the main javascript object. Please get in touch if you'd like to help out with that.

= Why doesn’t it work on all my content? =
Visual Chap will be **ONLY ACTIVE IN ‘EMPTY’ PARAGRAPHS** – which means it will bypass a particular paragraph if it finds there are already links in it.

= What about foo bar? =

No answer is a good answer to the foo bar dilemma.
